# grefine-ckan-storage-extension
Upload data directly from within Google Refine to CKAN using CKAN storage API

This is an updated version of earlier grefine-ckan-storage extension (http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2011/grefine-ckan/ and https://github.com/fadmaa/grefine-ckan-storage-extension). 

The earlier version did not support CKAN API v3. Now the extension works with CKAN API v3 and CKAN 2.3a.
